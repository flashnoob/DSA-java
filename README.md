**Title:** DSA Journey in Java (Data Structures & Algorithms)

**Description:**

This repository serves as my personal playground for delving into the fascinating world of data structures and algorithms (DSA) using Java. As I embark on this learning journey, I'll be documenting my progress by implementing various data structures and algorithms from scratch. This includes in-depth explanations, code examples, and potential applications.

**Getting Started:**

- **Prerequisites:** A basic understanding of Java programming is recommended. I'm using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWLxhF3b5P8
- **IDE:** Feel free to use your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Popular options include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans. These IDEs provide valuable features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.

**Structure:**

This repository will be organized logically to enhance navigation and exploration:

- **`src/main/java`:** This directory will house the Java source code for your data structure and algorithm implementations. Create separate packages for distinct categories (e.g., `sorting`, `searching`, `trees`, `graphs`).
- **`README.md`** (This file): You're currently viewing it! It provides an overview of the repository's purpose, structure, and contribution guidelines.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` (Optional):** If you plan to welcome contributions from others, consider creating a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file outlining the process for creating pull requests and maintaining code quality standards.

**Learning Resources:**

- **Books:**
    - "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava (Visual approach)
- **Online Courses:**
    - [https://www.edx.org/learn/data-structures]([https://www.edx.org/learn/data-structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWLxhF3b5P8))
- **Websites:**
    - GeeksforGeeks [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/): Great explanations and practice problems
    - LeetCode [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/), HackerRank [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/): Platforms for honing your DSA skills with coding challenges

**Contribution Guidelines:**

While this repository is primarily for my personal learning, feel free to fork it, make changes, and create pull requests if you have improvements or additional data structures/algorithms to share.

**Roadmap:**

- I plan to progressively explore and implement various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary search trees, heaps, etc.), and graphs.
- I'll focus on understanding how these structures work, their time and space complexities (Big O notation), and common operations associated with them.
- As I advance, I'll delve into renowned algorithms for sorting, searching, graph traversal, and more.
- My ultimate goal is to solidify my DSA foundation and become proficient in designing and implementing efficient algorithms in Java.

I hope this README serves as a valuable guide as you embark on your DSA journey in Java!
